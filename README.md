The default applications that we aim to develop to this release is:

## Calculator
The calculator was planned to have a custom parser generator, but never made it to the final list of features. It is   still under heavy development to get the clinks out of it, but is almost done and ready to be released!  
**Please view the issues tab and the milestones tab to view our goals of Calculator for this first release.**   
   
## Text Editor
The Text Editor is a simple editor, that simply saves a TXT file to a specified location and loads it and allows the user to modify parts of it and create new TXT files. **Currently haulted, and all focus is on Calculator debugging.**
   
## System Information
The System Information app will gather the reported java system properties and display it to the user. **Currently haulted to the last priority.**
